The project is s WPF-based PDF DRM Viewer that uses the MoonPdfLib library and contains two tools, file encryption tool, and PDF Viewer. With file encryption tool, User can encrypt and add password, expired date, reading limit protections into PDF file. After the encryption, the PDF file will not be open in any common PDF viewer, like Acrobat Reader, Google Chrome, etc.
 The only way to read/view is using the PDF viewer in this project. When the user opens the file, the viewer will ask related info that encryption added in.
